 *
 * Special Cases:
 * (1) Natural cubic splines with only two control points reduce to linear interpolation.
 * (2) If required but not defined, tangent vectors at a spline knot are calculated from the control point data using a quadratic fit to the control point and the two adjacent control points (if internal) or, if at an edge, by a vanishing second derivative. This calculation reduces locally to a natural spline.
 * (3) If not expected but provided, then extraneous information is to be ignored, e.g., tangent vectors for linear splines.
 *
 * Vertical:
 * (1) Control points are (X,Y,-).
 * (2) Parameter values are interpreted as depth => (X,Y,Z), where the depth to Z conversion depends on the vertical CRS direction.
 *
 * Piecewise Linear:
 * (1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).
 * (2) Piecewise interpolation in (X,Y,Z) as a linear function of P.
 *
 * Natural Cubic:
 * (1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).
 * (2) First and second derivatives at each knot are inferred from a quadratic fit to the two adjacent control points, if internal, or, if external knots, by specifying a vanishing second derivative.
 *
 * Tangential Cubic and Minimum-Curvature.
 * (1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).
 * (2) Tangent vectors are (P,TX,TY,TZ). Tangent vectors are defined as the derivative of position with respect to the parameter. If the parameter is arc-length, then the tangent vectors are unit vectors, but not otherwise.
 * (3) Interpolating minimum-curvature basis functions obtained by a circular arc construction. This differs from the "drilling" algorithm in which the parameter must be arc length.
 *
 * Z Linear Cubic:
 * (1) (X,Y) follow a natural cubic spline and Z follows a linear spline.
 * (2) On export, to go from Z to P, the RESQML "software writer" first needs to determine the interval and then uses linearity in Z to determine P.
