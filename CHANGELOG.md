## Bug Fixes

### #67 — TriangulatedSurface node count 3× overcount 🐛⚠️🧪
**File:** `WorkProductComponent.ts`
**Problem:** `IndexableElementCount` reported ~3× the actual node count for triangulated surfaces, causing OSDU validation failures and incorrect array sizing.
**Root cause:** The counter `pNodeCount++` fired on every coordinate value (x, y, z separately) instead of once per 3D point.
**Fix:** Move the increment inside a `mod === 0` branch so it fires once per complete (x,y,z) tuple.

### #126 — Invalid dateTime → HTTP 500 🐛⚠️
**File:** `Json2Xml.ts`
**Problem:** Submitting an invalid date string (e.g. `"not-a-date"`) via `PUT /witsml/store` caused an unhandled `RangeError` from `new Date(...).toISOString()`, returning a 500 to the client.
**Fix:** Added `isNaN(d.getTime())` guard; returns HTTP 400 with a descriptive message instead.

### #130 — DELETE locked dataspace returns 204 🐛⚠️🧪
**File:** `ResqmlClient.ts`
**Problem:** Deleting a locked dataspace appeared successful (204) because a `.catch()` block silently swallowed the ETP `ProtocolException` (code 27 = locked resource).
**Fix:** Removed the overly broad catch; the 403 now propagates to the REST caller.

### CRS-2 — ArealRotation wrong for rotated local CRS 🐛⚠️🧪
**File:** `WorkProductComponent.ts` → `createSpatialInfoFrom2dPoints`
**Problem:** `SpatialArea` bounding box coordinates were incorrect when the RESQML model used a rotated local coordinate reference system. The old code applied a simple `point + offset` translation, ignoring the CRS rotation angle.
**Fix:** Apply the full affine transform (`cosθ·x − sinθ·y + xOffset`, `sinθ·x + cosθ·y + yOffset`) using the areal rotation from the CRS definition.

---

## Non-Additive Behavioral Changes

### #125 — SIGTERM graceful shutdown ⚠️🧪
**Files:** `RestServer.ts`, `ControllerUtils.ts`
**Problem:** When Kubernetes sent SIGTERM during pod scaling or deployment, the process hung until the full grace period expired because no signal handler was registered. Any in-flight ETP transactions were abandoned (no rollback).
**Change:** Register a SIGTERM handler that: (1) stops accepting new requests, (2) rolls back open ETP transactions, (3) exits within 30 seconds. Consumers relying on abrupt termination behavior should verify no side effects.

### S1 — Default manifest type filter ⚠️🧪
**File:** `Manifest.ts`
**Problem:** `buildManifest()` returned every RESQML object (~600 records for a typical Volve-sized model), making the output unusable for most consumers and slow to ingest.
**Change:** Default filter now includes only Interpretations, Representations, and WITSML objects (~90% reduction). To restore previous behavior, pass `typePatterns: ["*"]` in the manifest options.

### A2 — Grid2d routing to StructureMap ⚠️🧪
**Files:** `StructureMap.ts`/`22.ts`, `SeismicBinGrid2Representation*.ts`
**Problem:** A depth-domain `Grid2dRepresentation` associated with a `HorizonInterpretation` fell through to `GenericRepresentation` (losing geological semantics).
**Change:** Now routes to `osdu:wks:work-product-component--StructureMap:1.0.0`. Downstream systems expecting the generic kind will see a different OSDU kind for these objects.

### Manifest builder: best-effort mode ⚠️🧪
**File:** `Manifest.ts`
**Problem:** A single converter error (e.g. malformed XML in one object) aborted the entire manifest build, returning nothing even though 99% of objects were fine.
**Change:** Errors are now caught per-object. Failed objects are logged and skipped; the manifest returns everything that succeeded. Callers should check the `errors[]` array in the response.

## CRS Enrichments (additive)

All changes in `WorkProductComponent.ts` → `createSpatialInfoFrom2dPoints` / `createSpatialInfo`.

### Vertical CRS extraction
**Motivation:** OSDU consumers performing 3D coordinate transforms need the vertical datum (e.g. MSL, LAT) but it was never populated.
**v2.0:** Reads `VerticalCrs.EpsgCode` from inline vertical CRS definition.
**v2.2:** Follows the DOR (data object reference) to resolve the vertical CRS object and extracts the EPSG code.

### localFrame metadata
**Motivation:** When RESQML uses a local engineering CRS (origin + rotation), the original frame parameters must be preserved for lossless OSDU→RESQML round-trip reconstruction.
**Output:** Returns all 9 local frame fields (`xOffset`, `yOffset`, `zOffset`, `arealRotation`, `projectedUom`, `verticalUom`, `originX`, `originY`, `originZ`) under the `rddms/localFrame/*` namespace.

### WKT CRS detection
**Motivation:** Models using non-EPSG coordinate systems (e.g. company-internal or WKT-defined) got zero spatial metadata because the code only checked for EPSG codes.
**v2.0:** Detects WKT string in `ProjectedUnknownCrs.Unknown` (heuristic: starts with `PROJCS[`).
**v2.2:** Reads `ProjectedWktCrs.WellKnownText` directly.

### LocalAuthority CRS (v2.2 only)
**Motivation:** RESQML v2.2 introduced `ProjectedLocalAuthorityCrs` for company-managed CRS codes, which had no mapping to OSDU reference data.
**Fix:** Maps the authority + code to an OSDU `CoordinateReferenceSystem` reference-data ID.

## New Converters

| Feature | Motivation | Key Files |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **M27 Phase 1** (9 schemas) | Upstream used approximate kind mappings (e.g. all organizations → GenericInterpretation), losing semantic distinctions | `StructuralOrganizationInterpretation.ts`…`GridConnectionSetRepresentation22.ts` |
| **SeismicLineGeometry** (#66) | 2D seismic lines had no dedicated OSDU kind; were dropped during manifest | `SeismicLineGeometry.ts` (7 unit tests) |
| **S2: WellLog flattening** | A WellboreFrame with N properties produced N+1 OSDU records; should be 1 WellLog | `WellboreFrameToWellLog.ts` / `22.ts` |
| **S3: MasterData dedup** | Re-ingesting the same EPC created duplicate BoundaryFeature master-data records | `MasterDataBoundaryFeature.ts` / `22.ts` |
| **A1: 15 type registrations** | 15 RESQML types were unregistered — silently skipped during manifest build | `ResqmlOsdu.ts` |
| **A3: Activity generation** | Ingested manifests had no lineage/provenance linking source EPC to output records | `Manifest.ts` |
| **A4+A7: WITSML converters** | Rig, Tubular, FluidsReport, BHARun, WellCompletion had no OSDU mapping | `WitsmlRig.ts`…`WitsmlWellCompletion.ts` |
| **O1: PropertyKind→UnitQuantity** | `UnitQuantityID` was always `undefined` for v2.2 PropertyKinds (QuantityClass lookup missing) | `PropertyType23.ts` |
| **S4: Auto-collaboration** | Every API call required a manual `x-collaboration` header; most callers forgot it | `Manifest.ts` — generates UUID v5 from dataspace name |
| **O4: Retry + array chunking** | Large HDF5 array uploads failed (payload too big); transient 503s crashed the client | `Util.ts`, `ResqmlClient.ts` — exponential backoff + 4MB chunk limit |
| **R4: Converter registry** | No runtime way to discover which RESQML/WITSML types are supported | `registerConverter.ts` + `GET /health/converters` endpoint |
| **#24: SSL config** | Cannot connect to ETP servers with self-signed certificates | `RDMS_ETP_SSL_VERIFY=false` env var in `config.default.env` |
| **#91/#23/#25: OpenAPI fixes** | Response schemas wrong; `x-collaboration` header undocumented | `Manifest.controller.ts` |
